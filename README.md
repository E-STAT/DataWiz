# DataWiz

Any data scientist would spend upwards of 50% of the time and effort in cleansing data. How great would it be if that were fully automated? This project aims to divert 20% of our efforts away from fancy ML models and into pure cleansing to producing an automated and repeatable process for data cleansing. Let's pause for a moment, on cutting the tree with an axe, and build a chainsaw.

Automated data cleansing for Decision Tree models (and similar models). Supports numpy and pandas.

Requires: Sklearn (plus an update to the preprocessing/label.py file) Pandas Numpy
